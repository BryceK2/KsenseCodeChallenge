# Ksense TS Code Challenge

1. You will send the payload to your webhook URL. You can only send it one time. Duplicate submissions or sending the same full name with different URLs will result in disqualification.
2. Once the payload is sent, you will be able to receive the secret message from it.
3. You must be prepared to receive and store the payload since you won't be able to retrieve it again.
4. After receiving the payload, you will enter the secret message (secret code) and your repository URL.
5. Timing is measured from the moment you submit the payload until you submit the secret code. This duration is a key factor in your evaluation.
6. You must submit your repository (via GitHub, GitLab, or another platform) containing your complete code after finishing the challenge. You are free to use any tools or frameworks you feel are appropriate.
7. Your submission will be graded on:

- Readability
- Efficiency
- Maintainability
- Adherence to best practices
- Time taken for submission

8. Our team works heavily with TypeScript, so good TypeScript usage will result in higher scores.
9. We prefer that you do not use AI tools to complete this exercise. We have methods to detect AI-generated code.
